<p>I am a Hip-Hop dancing snowboarder with a love for
lacrosse, soccer, and video games. You can usually
find me playing League of Legends or out and about
exploring Northern Virginia with my girlfriend.</p>

<p>I graduated from the College of William & Mary in 2014 with my Bachelors in Computer Science 
and a minor in Process Management and Consulting. My first 2 years out of school I worked 
down in Richmond VA at Genworth Financial in a development program trying out different technical roles.
In August of 2016 I moved up to Arlington VA and started working for Ventera as a technical Consultant.
I worked on the FNS contract for several months prior to transitioning to my current team working on the
CMS contract where I am currently the lead developer for PSVA.</p>
